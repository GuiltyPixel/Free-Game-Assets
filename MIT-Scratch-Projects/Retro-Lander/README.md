# Retro Lander for MIT Scratch
A complete, playable game project. Created for Harvard CS50x Class of 2015.

[Summary]
  Retro Lander is a game where you control the maneuvering thrusters of a lunar lander module and attempt to set it down safely in the designated landing area. The landing area is a red, flat zone generated somewhere on the terrain.

[How to Play]

  [Objectives]
    Land the lunar module on the flat, red target area with no more than 20 horizontal or vertical speed to win. Avoid the green lunar terrain, or you will crash. Landing too hard or while moving too fast horizontally will also cause a crash. Watch your fuel gauge, if you run out of fuel, you won't be able to fire your thrusters and you may crash.

  [Controls]
    Press the (Space) key to begin a new game.
    Press the W,A,S,D keys to move up, left, down, and right.

[Notes and Credits]
  Retro Lander is similar in style to the Lunar Lander game series. The first graphical version of which was released on the DEC GT40 terminal by Jack Burness in 1973.
