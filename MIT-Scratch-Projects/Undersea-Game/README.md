# Undersea Game Sprites
Free sprite assets for an underwater game

These are undersea assets intended for use with the MIT Scratch
programming environment. They were created for "Yet Another Fish Game",
a project by Xixibyte. They are provided here as transparent
PNGs. The game was made for Harvard's CS50x course, class of 2015.
